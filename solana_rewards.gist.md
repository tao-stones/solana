https://docs.solana.com/economics_overview


## Sources of remittances: 
- Protocol-based rewards: generated from inflationary issurances;
- transaction fee

Collectively, these rewards are distributed to validators;



- there are four RewardsTypes defined in code: 
  - Fee
  - Rent
  - Staking
  - Voting


## Vote Credit

- Validator earns one Vote Credit if his vote on a block was finalized (appended to ledger)
- At end of epoch, Vote Credits are used to determine Rewards (still how exactly?)
- Something to do with "Validator Uptime"

## Inflationary Rewards


## Staking Rewards

- determined by: inflatino rate, total number of staked SOLs, note's uptime and commission

## Inflation

- initial inflation rate: 8%, decrfeasing by 15% annually towards to 1.5%
